## Motivation

I was running url shortner using netlify & github for some time now.

In the meantime opportunity presented itself to work on shortener, in more 
intensive manner so I completed the project into personal, very useful tool I 
use every day.

I first design it in
[Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/G4JxLBqhy2yzY9EislD5oH/Crowdly?node-id=0%3A1),
then I code it up with CSS, following by adding interactivity with React.

Backed part (api) is done with node & mongo db. I took opportunity to use
swagger this time to [document my
api](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/ultrox/shortner/1.0.0) and finally
deploy with CI/CD pipeline with circle CI on netlify 
[here](https://prod-crowd.netlify.com/)
